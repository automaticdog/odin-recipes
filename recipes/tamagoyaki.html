      <p><b>Tamagoyaki</b> (卵焼き or 玉子焼き) is a sweetened rolled omelette cut into bite-sized slices that resemble fluffy golden pillows. With a slightly sweet taste and custardy texture, <i>tamagoyaki</i> is a popular dish both at breakfast and in lunchboxes across Japan.</p>

      <h2>How to Make It:</h2>
      <p>To make a basic <i>tamagoyaki</i>, you first beat the eggs just like you would with a regular American-style omelette. Then season the whisked eggs with sugar, mirin, soy sauce, and a pinch of salt before pouring a thin layer of the egg mixture into a pan to cook. Once the bottom of the egg mixture is set, roll it up in multiple thin layers until the egg looks like a thick log. Finally, shape the egg and slice it into thick pieces for serving.</p>
      <p>The great thing about making Japanese rolled omelette at home is that you have the flexibility to experiment and be creative with the shapes and fillings. You can also add other ingredients such as seaweed, cheese, veggies, salmon flakes, and meat into <i>tamagoyaki</i> to change up the flavors.</p>

    <div class="ingredients">
      <ul>
        <li>3 large eggs</li>
        <li>2 tbsp neutral-flavored oil (vegetable, rice bran, canola, etc)</li>
        <li>1½ sheets nori (dried seaweed)</li>
        <li>3 tbsp dashi (Japanese soup stock)</li>
        <li>2 tsp sugar</li>
        <li>1 tsp soy sauce</li>
        <li>1 tsp mirin</li>
        <li>2 pinch kosher salt</li>
        <br/>
        <li style="list-style: none;"><b>For garnish:</b></li>
          <ul>
            <li>3 oz daikon radish</li>
            <li>Soy sauce</li>

    <div class="steps">
      <h2>Steps:</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>Beat the eggs: First, beat eggs well in a bowl using either a fork, or chopsticks if you are an expert chopstick user.</li>
        <li>Add seasonings: Add one tablespoon each of soy sauce, mirin and sugar and a little salt to your mix.</li>
        <li>Heat up a pan: Put a small amount of cooking oil in your pan and bring it up to medium heat. Keep some kitchen roll handy to help keep the pan oiled during cooking.</li>
        <li>Cook the eggs: Add a small amount of your egg mix into the heated pan. Once the egg has cooked slightly so that the top is still slightly uncooked, push it over to the side of your pan.</li>
        <li>Add a little more oil to the pan using the kitchen roll: Add another small amount of the egg mix to your pan. Again, wait for this to cook a little, but before it sets on top. You can then begin to roll the first bit of egg over the mix you just put in the pan until you have a small roll of egg.</li>
        <li>Repeat the steps: Continue adding a small amount of egg while oiling the pan each time in between. As you add more egg and roll it up each time, your egg roll will start getting larger and easier to add new layers. Keep adding the egg in new layers until you have used it all up.</li>
        <li>Slice the <i>tamagoyaki</i>: Your <i>tamagoyaki</i> is now finished so remove from the pan and wait to cool before slicing it up into thin pieces with a sharp knife.</li>
      </ol>
